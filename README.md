# retrieval_base

A Python package for running atmospheric retrievals using high/moderate-resolution spectra of sub-stellar objects. 

Currently, the package is suited to:
 - VLT/CRIRES+ spectra in the J1226 and K2166 wavelength settings.
 - JWST/NIRSPEC spectra with the G395H grating.

## Installation
```
python -m pip install -e .
```
